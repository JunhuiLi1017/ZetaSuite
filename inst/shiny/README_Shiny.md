## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Package Not Found**: Make sure all required packages are installed
2. **Data Format Errors**: Ensure CSV files have correct column headers and data types
3. **Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider reducing the number of bins or filtering data
4. **SVM Analysis Fails**: Ensure you have sufficient positive and negative control samples

### Performance Tips

- For large datasets (>10,000 genes), consider preprocessing to reduce computational time
- Use the "Filter Low Count Cells" option for single-cell data to remove low-quality cells
- Adjust the number of bins based on your data size and computational resources
- Use `combine = TRUE` for faster event coverage analysis

### Error Messages

- **"Error loading data"**: Check file format and ensure all required files are uploaded
- **"Error in Quality Control"**: Verify that positive and negative control genes are present in the count matrix
- **"Error in Z-score calculation"**: Ensure negative control genes are properly formatted
- **"Error in Event Coverage"**: Check that Z-scores have been calculated first

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis Workflows

The application supports custom analysis workflows:

1. **SVM Background Correction**: Enable SVM analysis for improved accuracy
2. **Separate Direction Analysis**: Analyze decrease and increase directions separately
3. **Custom Thresholds**: Adjust Screen Strength thresholds for different sensitivity/specificity trade-offs
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple datasets by uploading different files

### Integration with R Scripts

The Shiny app can be integrated with custom R scripts:

```r
# Load results from Shiny app
zscore_results <- read.csv("zscore_results.csv", row.names = 1)
zeta_results <- read.csv("zeta_scores.csv", row.names = 1)

# Continue with custom analysis
# ...
```
